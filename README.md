## 1 - Description

Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed
in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and
set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally 
moving laser to earn as many points as possible.  

## 2 - Design

The game has been designed using keyboard controllers as the user uses the cursor keys to operate the ship and to fire bullets
at enemy ships. In addition, while a game is in progress the player can also choose whether to play with background music or 
not. Using Allegro's libraries, the player can enjoy both a brilliant graphic interface and high quality soundtrack 
reproduction. Here it's going to be explained the different parts of which the game developed is composed.
